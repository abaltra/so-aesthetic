# So Aesthetic

Simple script that will get a random image, slap a random quote on top and share it on twitter. Runs daily as a lambda triggered by a Cloudwatch rule in AWS. All terraformed.

## How to use

There's a simple to use Makefile with 4 instructions. Super creative name for all of them.

```shell
make build
make deploy
make clean

make all #runs all instructions
```

## Why tho

Was bored, and wanted to play with pillow's image manipulation tools. Also Terraform is pretty cool.
